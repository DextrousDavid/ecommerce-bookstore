> This is project is built for the purpose of learning MERN stack. It is built with Node.js backend and React.js frontend, both frontend and backend is running on digital ocean. In order to utilize the full functionality, the user has to be logged in as admin, which I already pre-entered the username and password in the inputField. If you would like to log in as general user, you could register an account. Please respect the site and don't use the admin account to destroy everything.

> The payment system is in sandbox mode, if you would like to try out, simply enter a test card number (4111 1111 1111 1111) with random cvv (123) and a valid date (11/22). Enjoy 🙂!
